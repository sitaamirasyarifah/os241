<h3>Week 01</h3>
1. [OS Main Site](https://os.vlsm.org/) <br>
The website established by Mr. RMS is a valuable resource, particularly for mastering OS232. It offers a plethora of useful materials such as assignments, slides, tutorials, reports, links, and various other resources.

2. [Cara Kerja Data Recovery Software](https://www.techradar.com/news/how-data-recovery-software-works#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20accidental,of%20the%20device%20in%20question.)<br>
Very useful websites! Sometimes we accidentally delete/lose data. This website explains how the data recovery process works, various types of data loss, and ways to minimize the risk of data loss.

<h3>Week 02</h3>
1. [What Is a Checksum](https://howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br>
The website contains explanations of what checksum is and its benefits. There's a lot to gain from this website, ranging from explanations of its usefulness, the level of importance of using this file, to the differences in algorithms for checksum.

2. [Symmetric vs Asymmetric Key Encription](https://geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-key-encryption/)<br>
This website explains in simple terms the differences between two methods of key encryption. It's interesting to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of each method so that we can choose according to our needs.

3. [Encryption - Symmetric Encryption vs Asymmetric Encryption - Cryptography - Practical TLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_g-M7UBqI8)<br>
The video provides an excellent overview of encryption, particularly symmetric and asymmetric encryption. The presenter uses simple language and helpful animations to explain the concepts, making it easy for beginners to understand.

4. [Public and Private Keys - Signatures & Key Exchanges - Cryptography - Practical TLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zyKvPvh808)<br>
This video, from the same channel as the previous one, shares similarities in its approach. The presenter explains complex concepts, such as public and private keys for encryption and signatures, in an engaging and enjoyable manner. I found it fascinating to learn about the concept of hybrid encryption for sending bulk data, which combines the strengths of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, as demonstrated by the speaker.

5. [Why Do We Need Cybersecurity](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/what-is-cyber-security)<br>
Cyber crime has become a very hot issue lately. Ranging from individuals, governments, and even organizations, have a high risk of getting cyber crime. But what exactly cyber crime is? Why do we need security and protection on our system?
